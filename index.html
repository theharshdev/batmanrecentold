                            Witnessing his parents' murder as a child, he devoted his life to fighting crime,
                            donning the persona of the Caped Crusader. Devoid of superpowers, Batman relies on his
                            unmatched intellect, physical prowess, and cutting-edge technology to combat villains like
                            the Joker and Two-Face. Behind the mask, he grapples with his inner demons and the fine line
                            between justice and vengeance. As a symbol of fear, hope, and resilience, Batman continues
                            to captivate audiences, showcasing the power of human determination in the face of darkness.
